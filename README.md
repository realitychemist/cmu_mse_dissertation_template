cmu_mse_dissertation_template
=============================

A LaTeX template for PhD dissertations that conforms to the MSE (Materials Science & Engineering) department's requirements.

This is a template for a CMU MSE dissertation/thesis overview.  This template was modified from cmuthesis.cls, published by David Koes (www.cs.cmu.edu/~dkoes), and subsequently modified by Raja Sambasivan to conform to ECE standards.  This version is forked from an updated version by Ryan Cohn (https://github.com/rccohn), which was changed to conform to MSE standards.  See that version for more document history.

As of 2021, the MSE department now requires these documents to follow the overal department of engineering standards.  These are currently available online (https://engineering.cmu.edu/education/academic-policies/graduate-policies/thesis-dissertation.html).  In case of link rot, they are recorded verbatim below:


> ### Title
> Your title is the first thing your readers read. It should announce the topic and communicate the conceptual framework of the thesis or dissertation using keywords that provide information to both the reader and potential search algorithms.
> ### Font
> Choose a single, readable and widely available typeface/font, such as Times New Roman, Arial or Helvetica. If using a less common typeface, embed the font in the electronic file. Avoid ornamental typefaces. In general, use at least ten-point or twelve-point font for the body of the text.
> ### Title page
> The first page of the pdf will be a title page.  The title page of the dissertation should follow the format specified in the template. Note that the title page must follow the template and not include additional information.
> 
> _**Note**: The title page requirements are shown in a linked document.  All text is the same size and horizontally centered on the page.  The title is in bold and capitalized, and may have a subtitle separated by a colon (:).  If the title runs across multiple lines, it should be single-spaced.  It is followed by a long break and then the text: "Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for \\ the degree of \\ Doctor of Philosophy in \\ Department of Enginering" with line breaks at the '\\'s.  Then after a line break: the author's first, middle, and last names, another line break, and a list of degrees obtained in the format "B.S., Engineering Department, University degree was obtained".  This is followed by a long break and then the text "Carnegie Mellon University \\ Pittsburgh, PA".  The final line on the title page should be the month and year when thre degree is expected to be awarded or the thesis overview will take place.  The title page is un-numbered._
